Contributions of any kind are welcome and encouraged, be they:

- Pull requests
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Words of encouragement
- :beer:

If you are interested in a particular feature, feel free to open an issue or 
send me an email.

Pull requests should include specs (though I don't mind writing them for a solid
feature). Keeping coding style consistent would be cool too - modulo a few 
parentheses, I tend to stick to the 
[GitHub Ruby style guide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby).
